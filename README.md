# Background
It is a semester-long project, focused on the analysis of verification for a v-shaped electrothermal microactuator (MEMS). This analysis employs a state space model for a controller design of a v-shaped electrothermal microactuator. The controller design was modeled using MATLAB and MATLAB Simulink.

# Project Report
The project report has been crafted in the format of an IEEE journal, adhering to the specified requirements for the semester-long project. The derivation for the equations mentioned in the report is available in the "Governing_Eqs" PDF file.

# MATLAB Model
Upon request, all MATLAB codes and MATLAB Simulink models will be made available. The MATLAB code labeled "controller_design," included here, generates a few figures within the report.
